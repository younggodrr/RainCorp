# API Integration Prompt Template

Use this template when asking about integrating new API endpoints into the Magna Coders codebase.

---

**Endpoint Details:**
- **Method:** `[GET / POST / PUT / DELETE]`
- **URL:** `[ENDPOINT_PATH]` (e.g., `/api/posts`, `/api/chat/{id}/messages`)
- **Description:** `[What does this endpoint do?]`
- **Payload/Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "key": "value",
    "optional_key": "value"
  }
  ```
- **Response Structure (Optional):**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "123",
    "status": "success"
  }
  ```

**Integration Questions:**

Please analyze the codebase and answer the following:

1.  **Where** should this API call be implemented?
    *   Which specific component (`src/components/...`) or page (`src/app/...`) is the most appropriate location?
    *   Should it be extracted into a hook (like `useMessages`) or a service?

2.  **How** should it be integrated?
    *   Is it triggered by a user action (e.g., button click, form submission)?
    *   Is it fetched on component mount (e.g., `useEffect`)?
    *   Does it need optimistic UI updates?

3.  **Are there existing UI elements** ready for this?
    *   Do we need to create new buttons, modals, or loading states?
    *   Which existing components can be reused?

4.  **Implementation Pattern:**
    *   Confirm strict usage of `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`.
    *   Should I use the standard `authenticatedFetch` pattern or something else?
    *   What are the error handling requirements?
