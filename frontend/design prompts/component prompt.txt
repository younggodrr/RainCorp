Master Refactoring Prompt
Task: Refactor the following Next.js page to improve modularity by extracting distinct UI sections into reusable components.

Project Context:

Framework: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Lucide React
Component Directory: frontend/src/components
Instructions:

Analyze the Page:

Identify repeated UI patterns (e.g., items inside a .map() loop like cards or list items).
Identify self-contained logical sections (e.g., specific headers, pagination controls, complex filters, sidebars).
Identify generic UI elements that could be reused elsewhere.
Extract Components:

For each identified section, create a new .tsx file in frontend/src/components. except for the top navigation bar and left panel component. we have those
Name the component descriptively (e.g., ProjectCard.tsx, FilterBar.tsx).
Props & Types: Define a strict TypeScript interface for the component's props.
Imports: Move all necessary imports (icons, next/link, next/image, etc.) to the new file.
Interactivity: If the component needs state or event handlers, decide whether to handle it internally (add "use client") or accept callbacks as props from the parent.

Extract Constants & Data:
Identify static data arrays, configuration objects, or helper functions defined within the component.
Move these into a separate `constants.tsx` or `data.ts` file in the same directory.
Export them and import them back into the main page or the new components as needed.
Refactor the Original Page:

Import the new components.
Replace the original JSX code blocks with the new component instances.
Pass all necessary data and event handlers as props.
Remove any unused imports or variables to clean up the file.
Quality Check:

Ensure the visual design (Tailwind classes) remains exactly the same.
Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) still function correctly.
