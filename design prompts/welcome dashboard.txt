🔴 MASTER UI RECREATION PROMPT — MagnaCoders Dashboard / Home Feed

Design a modern SaaS-style community dashboard for a developer collaboration platform called “MagnaCoders.” The interface should feel warm, productive, clean, and momentum-driven, with soft pastel backgrounds, rounded surfaces, subtle shadows, and bold red accent CTAs.
